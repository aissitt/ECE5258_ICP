# ECE5258_ICP

This repository contains code for training and evaluating deep learning models for hemodynamic simulations, specifically focusing on Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and aneurysm data. The repository supports models with both data-driven and physics-informed loss functions using a 3D U-Net architecture.
